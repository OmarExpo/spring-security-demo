SPRING SECURITY DEMO

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
  _ Java 11
  _ Spring Web
  _ Spring Security
  
 Created first simple CRUD REST API with one endpoint which is supposed to be reading by studentId.
 Note: we added 3 students statically in the controller in order to have something to access through the API.
 
 This project has multiple parts (aka branches) in order to showcase different scenario:
 _ non authenticated API access
 _ Form-based login (aka default Spring Security)
 _ Basic-Auth (most basic with pop-up)
 _ JWT
